Your uncle has been accused of murdering your grandparents! After a while, the police arrive and takes the uncle away for questioning. Though there's still tension, you all seem relieved. 
You decide to hit the hay and go to bed for the night. Those few hours of peace are disturbed when you wake up to screaming. Another body had been discovered, and this time it's your cousin!   

Looks like you were wrong in your deductions. Another vote must be held! You all assemble in the main room for debate. There is still a few hours left before the police arrives again. Who will you vote for?
