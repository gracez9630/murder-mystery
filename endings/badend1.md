Your second cousin has been accused of murdering your grandparents! After a while, the police arrive and takes the second cousin away for questioning. Though there's still tension, you all seem relieved.
With that done, the player and relatives decides to go to sleep.

For some reason, the player wakes up with a sudden chill down their spine. You decided to check the rooms to see if anything strange is going on.

As you fall down, you could see a shadowy silhouette behind the player as their vision blurrs.

You were *very* wrong in your choice, it looks like you've been murdered!
