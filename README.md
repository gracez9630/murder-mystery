# murder-mystery

In this project, we worked together in making a simple murder mystery game for the past weeks. The purpose of this project was to acustom ourselves with collaborating and linking files to another file.

For our planning, we used google drawing to format how the game would go and which files would go to which. The google drawing can be found right below this:
