It was a dark, rainy night out. You were driving along your usual path home, exhausted from your job, when you noticed that your gas tank was almost empty. You still had a good distance to go before you got back to your house, there's no
way you would make it like this! And you really don't want to sleep in your car...   

Soon, you find yourself stopped in front of a cozy looking house. This just so happens to be your grandparents' house, surely they would let you stay for the night. Your assumptions are correct! They welcome you with open arms, and invite you to
sleep in the guest room while the storm dies down. Looks like there's other company too. Your Aunt, Uncle, and your two cousins have also crashed here. You're awfully tired, so you make your greetings fast before heading to the spare guest room.

Not long after, everyone decides to go to bed. The room setup is described as so:

* Room 1 includes the player and the cousins
* Room 2 includes the aunt and uncle
* Room 3 includes the grandparents
